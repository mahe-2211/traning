A factorial is the product of all the natural numbers less than or equal to the given number n.Sheela wants to know how its working in programming.

For Example,

    The factorial of 6 is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which is 720.
could you please help her to write the program to find the factorial of a number.
